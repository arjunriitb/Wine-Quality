# Wine-Quality

Determining the quality of red wine and white wine. Quality is determined by providing a rating to the wine based upon 11 features.

If the 11 features are given then we can predict the quality or the rating of the wine.

In the dataset there are data for red wine and white wine.

I have trained the model using Random Forest and SVR and I have compared the models.

I have found the importance of each feature used in the model.

Details and my observations found from the model are given in the text cell in the code itself.
